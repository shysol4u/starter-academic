I am a Postdoctoral Research Assocaite at Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, USA. My broad research interests are understanding immunity pathways in plants. At present, I am majorly focusing on pathosystems: Barley-Wheat stem rust, Barley- Fusarium head blight (FHB), and soybean- Sclerotinia stem rot.

Apart from research, I am a big fan of sports, particularly cricket. I love to read books on the Kindle app and watch historical fiction on OTT.
